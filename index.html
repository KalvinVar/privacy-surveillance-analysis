            <h2 class="section-title">Understanding the Problem</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">From what I've seen, digital privacy and surveillance have become one of the biggest sociological issues we're facing right now. Every time we go online, we're basically feeding into what researchers call <strong>surveillance capitalism</strong>, a system where companies collect our personal data, analyze it, and turn it into profit (Zuboff, 2019). The problem is that this creates a huge power imbalance. Big tech companies and governments know everything about us, but we barely know what they're doing with our information. And that's not just annoying. It actually threatens our freedom and how democracy works (Cinnamon, 2017).</p>

                    <h3>Conflict Theory</h3>
                    <p>When you look at surveillance through conflict theory, it's pretty clear that there's a power struggle going on. Tech giants are basically hoarding our personal data and turning it into profit, while most of us have no real control over what happens to our information (Cinnamon, 2017). They know everything about us (what we search for, who we talk to, where we go) but we know almost nothing about what they're actually doing with all that data (Zuboff, 2015). That imbalance is what creates inequality in the digital world.</p>

                    <h3>Structural Functionalism</h3>
                    <p>I know data collection can serve some useful purposes — like keeping us safe or making apps more personalized. But there's a point where it crosses a line and becomes dysfunctional. When surveillance gets so invasive that people stop trusting institutions, or when it makes people scared to speak freely online, that's a breakdown of the social contract. The Snowden revelations showed us just how far that breakdown had gone (Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, 2014).</p>

                    <h3>Symbolic Interactionism</h3>
                    <p>Privacy and consent aren't just technical issues — they're social concepts that have completely changed in the digital age. I've noticed how websites and apps use what are called "dark patterns" — basically design tricks that manipulate you into sharing more information than you actually want to. It's not always obvious, but these patterns shape how we think about giving consent and what our relationship with technology should look like (Richards & Hartzog, 2019).</p>

                            <li>Facial recognition tech has some serious problems when it comes to accuracy. Studies show error rates as high as 34.7% for darker-skinned women, compared to less than 1% for lighter-skinned men (Buolamwini & Gebru, 2018). That's a huge gap, and it can lead to real harm.</li>
                            <li>Predictive policing algorithms keep reinforcing the same discriminatory patterns we see in law enforcement, making things worse for communities of color</li>
                            <li>Data brokers are selling location information from mobile apps to agencies like ICE, letting them track undocumented immigrants without even needing a warrant (Biddle, 2020)</li>

                            <li>There's basically a two-tiered system now: people with money can pay for privacy, while everyone else has to use "free" services that collect their data. Most households earning under $20,000 annually know about the privacy risks but can't afford the tools to protect themselves (Madden, 2017). That's not fair.</li>
                            <li>Low-wage workers face way more surveillance than higher-paid employees — things like keystroke monitoring and facial recognition at work. Meanwhile, people in higher-income jobs get to keep more of their privacy (Eubanks, 2018)</li>
                            <li>People with lower incomes end up in what researchers call a "privacy-poor, surveillance-rich" situation, even though they're just as aware of the risks as everyone else (Gangadharan, 2017)</li>

                            <li>Dating apps collect really sensitive information about people's sexual orientation, which can be dangerous for LGBTQ+ folks, especially in places where being out isn't safe</li>

                                <li>72% of Europeans have heard of GDPR, with 40% knowing what it is (European Commission, 2024)</li>
                                <li>8-26% reduction in tracking cookies on EU websites after GDPR implementation (Degeling et al., 2019)</li>

                            <p>All those consent pop-ups get annoying and people stop paying attention. Compliance is expensive, which helps big corporations more than small ones. Enforcement isn't consistent across borders. Plus, these laws don't really challenge the underlying business model — they just put some guardrails on it. And they still put a lot of responsibility on individuals to protect themselves</p>

Because everyone's already on platforms like Facebook, there's pressure to stay there even if they're not private. This creates a new kind of "privacy divide" where only people who can afford protection actually get it</p>

                            <p>Education builds knowledge that whole communities can share and use. It treats privacy as something you can learn instead of blaming people for not knowing.

                            <p>It's hard to reach everyone who needs this education. Sometimes there's so much information that people just shut down and don't know where to start. Education can only do so much when people don't have real alternatives to the big platforms. There's also a risk of blaming individuals for not protecting themselves when really the system is the problem. And not everyone has equal access to training</p>

                <h3>Comparative Analysis</h3>
                <p><strong>Most Promising Approach:</strong> Honestly, I think we need all three working together. Laws give people actual rights they can enforce. Technical tools make it possible to actually be private in practice. And education helps people understand their rights and push for change. No single approach is going to fix everything, but together they create what security people call "defense in depth."</p>
                <div class="insight">
                    <strong>Critical Limitation:</strong> Here's the thing though — all three of these strategies kind of treat privacy as an individual problem when it's really a structural one. They work best when we also push for bigger changes to how surveillance capitalism actually works. That might mean breaking up monopolies, letting workers negotiate over data rights collectively, or finding completely different ways to fund digital services besides selling our information.

My choices matter, but they're also shaped by the systems around me.</p>
